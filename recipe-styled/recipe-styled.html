     <p>We all claim to have the best chocolate chip cookies, but I promise this recipe is to die for! It's also super simple, which is perfect for anyone who knows nothing about baking. These cookies are crispy and chewy yet fluffy and doughy. Perfectly buttery and sweet with every bite.</p>
     <h2 class="headers">Tips for making cookies</h2>
        <ul>    
            <li>Mix wet and dry ingredients separately, then add the wet mixture to the dry mixture</li>
         <li>Use <i>LOTS</i> of mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, nuts, candy or whatever else you might enjoy</li>
         <li>Use a scoop instead of a spoon. It's a lot easier to get the dough off, plus you'll get the same size every time</li>
         <li>Freeze your leftover dough rather than cooking the whole batch and letting them all go to waste</li>
         <li>Bake until they don't look quite done yet. This is because they set up as they sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes, meaning they will cook for a little more once out of the oven. This will prevent you from overcooking your cookies!</li>
            <li>Let them cool for about 5 minutes before you remove them from the sheet</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="headers">Ingredients and Equpiment</h2>

         <li>Meausuring spoons and cups</li>

        <h2 class="headers">Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>

         <li>Roll 2-3 TBS (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop to make your cookies).</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just <b>BARELY</b> starting to turn brown.</li>
         <li>Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.</li>
